# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator


# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
# env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  # To install alacritty terminfo, run the following command from alacritty's
  # root folder:
  #   sudo tic -xe alacritty,alacritty-direct extra/alacritty.info
  # TERM: alacritty
